I earned my bachelor's degree from the Nanyang Institute of Technology and my master's degree from Chengdu University of Information Technology, where I was supervised by Professor Tang Dan. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, with guidance from Professors Zhong Yong and Li Shaobo. During my doctoral studies, I also conducted visiting research under Professor Zewei Chu at Google, as well as Professors Huajun Chen and Qiang Zhang at Zhejiang University.

In addition to my academic achievements, I worked as an architecture engineer at Inspur Group, where I led the development of the Zhilin Large Model, an engineering project based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced search engine, designed for the Knowledge Center of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Currently, I am an assistant researcher at the Information Research Center of Military Science at the Academy of Military Sciences.

My research interests include language models, protein language models, computer vision, and ecology.

## Education

### Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences

- **Supervisors**: Professors Zhong Yong and Li Shaobo
- **Visiting Supervisors**: Professor Zewei Chu (Google), Professors Huajun Chen and Qiang Zhang (Zhejiang University)

### Master's in Computer Science, Chengdu University of Information Technology

- **Supervisor**: Professor Tang Dan
- **Honors**:
  - National First-Class Scholarship (awarded twice)
  - Recommended by the college to join the Communist Party of China
- **Thesis**: **Key Event Detection and Phrase Extraction in Wikipedia**
  - Researched methods to identify turning points in Wikipedia articles and extract core phrases related to these points using data mining models.
  - **Contributions**:
    - Collected and preprocessed data from Wikipedia using web crawlers, formatting it for analysis.
    - Applied the shapelet algorithm to classify articles based on editing intervals.
    - Extracted key information using phrase extraction algorithms to enhance the precise description of core content.
  - **Abstract**:
    - With the rapid development of the internet, the number of participants in online collaborative work is increasing. Phenomena such as cooperation, disputes, and negotiations have prompted scholars to model real-world social issues. However, difficulties in data collection make it challenging to construct computable state machines. In recent years, the increase in online data records has drawn widespread attention to the field of social computing. Wikipedia, as a typical repository of group behavior data, provides rich records of editor interactions.
    - This thesis addresses two main problems: identifying turning points in articles and extracting core phrases related to these points. By analyzing two types of data changes in Wikipedia—editing time changes and information volume changes—the study defines and processes relevant features before analysis. The research extracts key nodes from Wikipedia based on time intervals, providing significant insights into understanding the development of current events.
    - While conventional natural language processing methods can identify keywords, commonly used topic models often extract large amounts of irrelevant information. This study innovatively applies algorithms to enhance the precise description of an article's core content.

### Bachelor's in Computer Science, Nanyang Institute of Technology

- **Honors**:
  - National Second-Class Scholarship
  - Active applicant to join the Communist Party of China
- **Extracurricular Activities**:
  - **President of the Innovation Club**
    - Led the development of a PHP web application similar to the 12306 train ticket booking system.
- **Thesis**: **Course Scheduling System Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm**
  - Developed a course scheduling system to optimize resource allocation and reduce conflicts using a simulated annealing algorithm implemented in PHP.
  - **Contributions**:
    - Designed a flexible data structure supporting various constraints such as teacher availability, classroom capacity, and course conflicts.
    - Implemented a PHP-based framework for the simulated annealing algorithm with adjustable parameters to suit different scales of scheduling problems.
    - Created a user-friendly interface for visualizing and modifying course schedules, enhancing user experience.
  - **Abstract**:
    - As the education industry continues to develop, reasonable course scheduling has become an important factor in improving teaching efficiency and student satisfaction. This thesis proposes a course scheduling system based on the simulated annealing algorithm, aiming to resolve conflicts and optimize resource utilization in course arrangements.
    - The system constructs an initial course schedule model based on user-inputted course information, teacher timetables, classroom resources, and student course selections. Using the simulated annealing algorithm, the system iteratively generates and evaluates multiple scheduling schemes, gradually reducing the energy function through a simulated annealing process to optimize the course arrangement.
    - Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively reduces conflict rates and improves resource utilization when handling complex course scheduling problems, providing a practical solution for school teaching arrangements.
- **Additional Experience**:
  - Recommended to attend the Chinese Academy of Sciences Summer Camp but was not admitted for graduate studies.
  - Adjusted to pursue a master's degree at Chengdu University of Information Technology, where the research group PI also served as:
    - A master's supervisor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    - Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the CAS Publishing House
    - Ph.D. supervisor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
    - Currently seconded to a local municipal party committee
